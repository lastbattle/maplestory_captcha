A huge collection of English [MapleStory](https://maplestory.com/)'s captcha text in jpg that I have collected over the years (dont as me how I got it). I simply do not need them anymore.
Pre-Big Bang MapleStory up till version 190 when they have switched to mostly using Runes (Up, Down, Left, Right arrow keys). 
Modern MapleStory still uses them occasionally. 
It is used throughout the game from Lie-Detector (anti-macro item), logins, to NPC conversations. 

These images are not labelled, and by releasing these I'm just allowing anyone who needs them to access this.
Most modern LLMs such as LLaMa 3.0, OCRs OpenCV should be able to solve it with ease at 70% accuracy without prior training. 

6,127 .png(s) in total.
